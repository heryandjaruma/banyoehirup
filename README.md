**BanyoeHirup** is derived from the Javanese word 'Banyu', signifying 'water', and the Sundanese term 'Hirup', meaning 'life'. Combined, they paint a vivid picture: *The Water of Life*. This emphasizes water's paramount role as the sustenance of life, nurturing every living organism on our beautiful Earth.
